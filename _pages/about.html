<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
I am a husband, father, and an Oracle DBA for a retail company.
</p>

<p>
  When I can, I go outside. I love to hike, camp, play in the woods with my kids, work in the woods or the garden. If I
happen to tire of being outside, you will probably catch me on the couch watching sports or movies, maybe reading a book, or cooking in the kitchen.

<p>
At work, I've been an Oracle DBA for about 10 years. I have worked with Oracle 9i through 19c. Data Guard, RAC, ASM,
Goldengate, AWR/ADDM, RMAN. Building databases, restoring databases, tuning databases. Really anything you can think of
with Oracle, I have probably touched it at some point.

<p>
In 2021, I completed a Masters of Science in Data Science from Bellevue University. I am currently exploring how to
merge my world, the database, and the data science world into one exciting world!
