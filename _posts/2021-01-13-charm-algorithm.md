# Charm Algorithm
[Git Repo](https://github.com/nps1984/machine-learning/tree/master/charm)

This python file here may look simple; it is just over a 100 lines, there are no custom classes, and I am using basic
python3 code. But this took me nearly two 40 hour weeks to complete! The goal of this assignment was to recreate the
charm algorithm based on pseudocode from a machine learning textbook. Again, it sounds simple, but the text was dense
and complicated to understand

## Summary
It enumerates closed sets using a dual itemset-tidset search tree, using an efficient hybrid search that skips many levels.
It also uses a technique called diffsets to reduce the memory footprint of intermediate computations. Finally it uses a
fast hash-based approach to remove any "non-closed" sets found during computation
