# Oscar Predictions
[Git Repo](https://github.com/nps1984/ds-intro-stats)

## Summary
This was one of my first major "data science" projects in my data science program. It was done in the R language, which admittedly I was very unfamiliar with.
As you go through this, you will probably note that I didn't really know what I was doing in terms of data science. But I am highlighting this project because of a few things:
* The R code is decent, especially for a beginner
* It is (nearly) fully contained within the RMD file
* It highlights my abilities with databases

## Results
As noted in the project files, working with these datasets in R was difficult for me. 
So I created a local postgresql database, imported the data and used SQL to extract 
the data in an easier to use format. The SQL is provided throughout the documentation. 
The process to build and import the data is not unfortunately.
