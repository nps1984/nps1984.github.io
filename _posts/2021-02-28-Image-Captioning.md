# Image Captioning
[Git Repo](https://github.com/nps1984/DSC680/tree/main/image-captioning)
This project was an attempt to caption images from the Flickr8k dataset. 

## Summary 
It used the provided image captions as a vocabulary for my caption generator. 
 
This project used transfer learning from an existing CNN model trained on the ImageNet dataset.
It then used an LSTM model to generate the captions based on the features extracted from the images.

## Results
The results were mixed. The model was efficient in training and it produced captions that were related to the image. 
But I did not think they were always coherent or accurate.
