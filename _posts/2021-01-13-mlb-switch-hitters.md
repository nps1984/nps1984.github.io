# DSC530 - Efficacy of MLB Switch Hitters
[Git Repo](https://github.com/nps1984/DSC530/tree/master/mlb-switch-hitters)

## Summary
The idea behind this project was to determine if switch hitters were actually
"worth it" or if they should just focus on hitting with their strongest hand.
This project made use of the ThinkStats repo from Alan Downey.

## Results
Some conclusions I've made is that right-handed hitters are more consistent against
left handed and right handed pitching. Left-handed hitters struggle more against
left-handed pitchers. There are some right-handed hitters that hit very well against
left-handed pitchers. And there are some left-handed hitters that hit very well against
right-handed pitchers.

As far as switch hitters go, they seem to fall in the middle. They tend to do a little
better against left-handed pitchers than left-handed hitters. And they tend to do a
little better against right-handed pitchers than right-handed hitters.

I set out on this project because I thought switch-hitting may be a gimmick.
But I think it turns out that it is a valid approach to hitting.
So if you are an 18 year old, budding baseball player on the cusp, it may be beneficial
for you to take up switch-hitting, especially if you struggle against the opposite hand.

I think the one thing to keep in mind here is that there are some really talented
baseball players and they can rake no matter who they are playing against.
