# Breast Cancer Prediction
[Git Repo](https://github.com/nps1984/breast-cancer/tree/main)
This project was an attempt to use an CNN model against images to detect the occurence of breast cancer.

## Summary 
It used histopathological images as part of a modified version of the PCam dataset. It was pulled from a Kaggle competition.
 
The model was a CNN that looked for a single pixel of cancer in a 32px x 32px region of the image.

## Results
The results were very good.
