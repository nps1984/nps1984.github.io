# DSC640 Data Visualizations -  Infographic
[Git Repo](https://github.com/nps1984/DSC640/tree/master/airline-safety)


## Summary
This data science course was all about data visualizations. We used the guise that
that we were employed by a major airline, and we had to reassure the public that
airline travel was safe. We produced many visualizations for this course, but the
infographic was one of my favorites.

## Results
I am by no means graphically inclined, so I thought [this](https://github.com/nps1984/DSC640/blob/master/airline-safety/visualizations/DSC640_NSalisbury_ProjectTask4_Infographic.png)
was pretty good
