# Project - MLB Pitch Data
[Git Repo](https://github.com/nps1984/machine-learning/tree/master/mlb-pitch-data)

## Summary
This was my final project for this course. Like most of my final projects,
I start off with ambitions of doing something great and unique.
But I tend to run out of time in the course or am in over my head in complexity.
This project was no different.

## Results

### Highlights
* A block of code that acceses an API in iterations, providing some error handling. I learned a significant amount regarding APIs because of this!
* Plenty of visualizations. They aren't great visualizations but they helped me become very familiar with the Seaborn library.
* An introduction to sklearn library. I found this to be most interesting, and started to experiment with many different pieces and parts.

### Lowlights
* This class was hard, and so I struggled to stay organized. There are several notebooks that seem to do similar things or nothing at all.
* My goal for this project was to ambitious at the start, so it had to change. And it changed many times. Leading to an outcome that is muddied and inconclusive.
