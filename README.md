# Portfolio
My portfolio based on the spectral design from http://html5up.net/spectral and by the talented [@ajlkn](http://twitter.com/ajlkn).

The design was morphed into a Jeykll theme for blog and portfolio entries by github user [arkadianriver]https://github.com/arkadianriver.

I have modified it slightly for my purposes.
